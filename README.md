# Todo App

This is a test driven todo app that I made in Tauri. It was developed for MacOS and leverages the Global Shortcut, File System, and Autostart plugins from Tauri. It uses the vitest testing framework for testing, npm and cargo for package management, class based React for dynamic rendering, and utlizes RoleModel Software's Optics design sytem.
